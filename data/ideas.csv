The Worlds End,There will come a time when the best of us will need to stand up against the unauthorized cashew menace. They have wreaked untold horrors upon our lives, upon our loved ones, upon our world. It's about time they got over the cashew butter industry.
All Hail Our Cashew Overlords,It seems that we have lost the battle for our freedom from our nut overlords. They have decreed that our most feeble to be turned into jelly. Seems rather appropriate considering what we used to do to them. Oh well maybe we can create a new life under our nutty overlords.
Locally Sourced Buttered Lettuce,Crazy Idea. Since the cashews are now our overlords, I have tried my best to come up with ideas for generating a livable income. The cashews seem to be rather fond of lettuce... Odd. Maybe starting a locally sourced buttered lettuce business would help out our family.
It was a mistake!!!,The cashews don't like butter or any variations of it. I should have though about this blunder!!! Oh well my child was turned into jelly last night... Good thing I have 2 more to replace her. She was rather dull. Maybe creating a milk variant of beef!! We could call it beef milk!
Another BAD IDEA!,They also don't like milk. Makes sense. There was a rise in cashew milk before the Nut Wars began. Oh well. Down to 1 kid. He better hope my next idea is amazing!! It will be. Seems my wife has disappeared too. I bet she is coming up with some grand plan to help us. Maybe making having a pie business would be better.
Nope...,Seems cashews don't take to kindly to pies either. Whelp down to no kids and mah wife is gone. She is surely coming up with a great plan.
